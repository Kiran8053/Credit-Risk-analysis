# Credit Risk Analysis

This project analyzes loan applicant data to identify risk factors that influence credit default. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and statistical modeling to build a credit risk scoring system.

## Problem Statement

A consumer finance company wants to minimize loan defaults by analyzing past applicant data. The goal is to identify patterns and risk factors that influence whether a client is likely to default on a loan. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to:
- Understand how customer and loan attributes relate to default behavior
- Identify key variables that differentiate high-risk applicants
- Handle missing data, detect outliers, and analyze data imbalance
- Provide actionable insights to improve loan approval strategies

This analysis will help the company make informed decisions such as rejecting high-risk applicants, adjusting loan amounts, or applying higher interest rates to mitigate financial risk.
